This platform is a research compedium of our academic publication below.

> [Gürol Canbek](http:gurol.canbek.com/Publications), Tugba Taskaya Temizel, and Seref Sagiroglu (2019). Multi-Perspective Analysis of Binary-Classification Performance Evaluation Instruments, *Performance Evaluation*, Elsevier (Submitted).

The platform provides the following materials:
- **PToPI.xlsx**: Periodic Table of (Binary-Classification) Performance (Evaluation) Instruments (open with Microsoft Excel™)
- **PToPI.dot** and **BicPiT.pdf**: Dependency graph codes and outputs for 49 performance measures and metrics ([Graphviz file](https://www.graphviz.org))
- **accbarrier.R**: Open-source R script for calculating the new classification **performance indicator called Accuracy Barrier (*ACCBAR*)** ([R](https://www.r-project.org) file)

An exploratory table (PToPI) presents the novel concepts introduced from multi-perspective analysis of **50 binary-classification performance instruments** (measures, metrics, and indicators). It is like a "periodic table of elements" in chemisstry.
The indicator is proposed in the article above to identify whether the classification performance is close to random classifier's performance.
PToPI.xlsx file also provides a sheet to calculate Accuracy Barrier (*ACCBAR*) indicator values and categories interactively.

Please, refer to http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/5c442vbjzg.1 for the Mendeley Data (**Binary-Classification Performance Evaluation Reporting Survey Data with the Findings**) providing comprehensive findings related to binary-classification performance evaluation reporting issues of **78 academic studies** within the last 7 years (2012–2018) that model some machine learning based **Android malware detection classifiers** and report their performance evaluation using some metrics.
