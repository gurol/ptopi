This platform is a research compedium of our academic publication below.

The platform provides the following materials:
- **BicPiT.xlsx**: Binary-Classification Performance Instruments Table (Microsoft Excel™ file)
- **BicPiT.dot** and **BicPiT.pdf**: Dependency graph codes and outputs for 49 performance measures and metrics ([Graphviz file](https://www.graphviz.org))
- **accbarrier.R**: Open-source R script for calculating the new classification **performance indicator called Accuracy Barrier (*ACCBAR*)** ([R](https://www.r-project.org) file)

The visualized table (BicPiT) presents comprehensive information related to **50 binary-classification performance instruments** (measures, metrics, and indicators). It is like a "periodic table of performance instruments".
The indicator is proposed in the article above to indicate whether the classification performance is close to random classifier's performance.
BicPiT.xlsx file also provides a sheet to calculate Accuracy Barrier indicator values and categories interactively.

Please, refer to http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/5c442vbjzg.1 for the Mendeley Data (**Binary-Classification Performance Evaluation Reporting Survey Data with the Findings**) providing comprehensive findings related to binary-classification performance evaluation reporting issues of **78 academic studies** within the last 7 years (2012–2018) that model some machine learning **Android malware classifiers** and report their performance evaluation using some metrics.

**Note**: Please, cite our article if you would like to use and/or adapt the code, datasets, methodology, and other materials provided and let us know. Thank you for your interest.
